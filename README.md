# Design of a Commercial Air & Spaceport for 2050 Operations
In this repository, we provide the Solidworks files that accompany the paper titled "Design of Commercial Air &amp Spaceport for 2050 Operations". Individual CAD models are available in the [CAD Files](https://github.com/andyeske/MARTEMIS/tree/main/CAD%20Files) folder.

### 1: Jetway

**Description:** Telescopic glass Jetway design, inspired from the glass design developed by thyssenkrupp.

**CAD Model Name:** The CAD files can be found in the [Jetway](https://github.com/andyeske/Air-and-Spaceport/tree/main/CAD%20Files/Jetway) folder, within [CAD Files](https://github.com/andyeske/MARTEMIS/tree/main/CAD%20Files). The assembly file is titled Jetway Assembly.SLDASM, and consists of 10 subcomponents named JetwayX.SLDPRT (X = 1 through 10) plus the generic Platform.SLDPRT part. This jetway assembly is fed into the larger airport assembly file, slotting each piece as a mosaic (as shown below).

### 2: Airport

**Description:** To be added.

**CAD Model Name:** To be added. The design aircraft for the airport is the 787-9 (ICAO 4D classification). All the relevant dimensioning and separation standards were extracted from the ICAO's [Annex 14](https://github.com/andyeske/Air-and-Spaceport/blob/main/Documents/ICAO%20Annex%2014.pdf) and Document 9157 [Part 1](https://github.com/andyeske/Air-and-Spaceport/blob/main/Documents/ICAO%20Doc%209157%20-%20Part%201.pdf) and [Part 2](https://github.com/andyeske/Air-and-Spaceport/blob/main/Documents/ICAO%20Doc%209157%20-%20Part%202.pdf), as elaborated in the paper.
