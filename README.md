### 1: Jetway

**Description:** Telescopic glass Jetway design, inspired from the glass design developed by thyssenkrupp.

**CAD Model Name:** The CAD files can be found in the [Jetway](https://github.com/andyeske/Air-and-Spaceport/tree/main/CAD%20Files/Jetway) folder, within [CAD Files](https://github.com/andyeske/MARTEMIS/tree/main/CAD%20Files). The assembly file is titled Jetway Assembly.SLDASM, and consists of 10 subcomponents named JetwayX.SLDPRT (X = 1 through 10) plus the generic Platform.SLDPRT part. This jetway assembly is fed into the larger airport assembly file, slotting each piece as a mosaic (as shown below).
