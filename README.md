### 1: 1400s Modules

**Description:** Main lunar habitat module, inspired largely by Sierra Aerospace's [LIFE 1400](https://www.sierraspace.com/commercial-space-stations/life-space-habitat/) design (hence, the name of the module!). 

**CAD Model Name:** 1400.SLDPRT (Main Module), 1400_interior_v1.SLDPRT (Cross sectional view with open walls), 1400_interior_v2.SLDPRT (Cross sectional view with closed walls), 1400_interior_v3.SLDPRT (the model with the furniture and 3 bedrooms, within the 1400_interior.zip file located in the following [folder](https://mitprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/andyeske_mit_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?login_hint=andyeske%40mit%2Eedu&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fandyeske%5Fmit%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FAndy%20MIT%2FMiscellaneous%2FMARTEMIS&view=0)), and Radiation Shield.SLDASM (1400 module enclosed by a radiation shield made of hexagonal structures, available within the Radiation Shield.zip file also in this [folder](https://mitprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/andyeske_mit_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?login_hint=andyeske%40mit%2Eedu&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fandyeske%5Fmit%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FAndy%20MIT%2FMiscellaneous%2FMARTEMIS&view=0)).
